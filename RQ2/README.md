# This is the experiment corresponding to RQ2 and RQ3 in our paper


## How to run the code in RQ2 and RQ3?

- First, copy the excel table in ``'../Result/'`` to ``'./Data'``

- Second, run the ``python './code/Wilcoxon.py'`` you will get some tables in ``'./output/'``.

In fact, now you have the p-value, which is appended to the end of table 4-6 of our paper (RQ2 and RQ3).

-run ``python './code/drawic.py'`` you will obtain wilcoxon pictures, but these plots is not used in our paper.

In fact, the results of RQ2 and RQ3 are already available when executing the code under ``'../Code/'``. The p-value is calculated here and is attached to the table.
