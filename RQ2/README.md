#这是对应论文中RQ2的实验
#包含了code, data, and output (i.e., the p-value data and some pictures).

How to run the code in rq2?

First, copy the excel table in '../Result/' to './Data'
Second, run the './code/Wilcoxon.py'. You will get some tables in './output/'.
Actually, now we get the p-values.
If you want to draw the pictures, please run the './code/drawic.py'. Then you will obtain some pictures, but these pictures have not used in our paper.
