# This is the experiment corresponding to RQ2 in the paper


## How to run the code in rq2?

-First, copy the excel table in '../Result/' to './Data'
-Second, run the ``'./code/Wilcoxon.py'`` you will get some tables in './output/'.
Actually, now we get the p-values, this is the result appended to the end of RQ2 of our paper.

run the ``'./code/drawic.py'`` you will obtain some pictures, these plots are the results of RQ3.
