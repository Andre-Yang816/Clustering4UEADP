# This is the experiment corresponding to RQ2 and RQ3 in our paper


## How to run the code in RQ2?

-First, copy the excel table in '../Result/' to './Data'

-Second, run the ``python Wilcoxon.py`` you will get some tables in './output/'.

Actually, now we get the p-values, this is the result appended to the end of RQ2 of our paper.

run the ``'./code/drawic.py'`` you will obtain some pictures, these plots are the results of RQ3.
