# This directory corresponds to the drawing of the experimental results of paper RQ1.

## Usage

- Run ``'./code/SKESD.R'`` to get the .txt file in the output folder;

- Run ``python './code/DrawPicture.py'`` gets the result of Figure 6-11 of the paper (stored in the pictures directory);

- Run ``'./code/sk_esd.R'`` to get the result of Figure 12-17 of the paper Results (stored in the picture_sk directory).

Note: Before running the code, you need to copy all the tables in the Result folder obtained previously to the 'main/RQ1/DrawPicData' directory, or you can directly change the path to read the data.
