# This directory corresponds to the drawing of the experimental results of paper RQ1, including code, data, output, picture_sk, and pictures.

## Usage

First, execute
``'./code/SKESD.R'``
to get the .txt file in the output folder and execute
``'./code/DrawPicture.py'`` gets the result of Figure 6-11 of the paper (stored in the pictures directory), execute ``'./code/sk_esd.R'`` to get the result of Figure 12-17 of the paper Results (stored in the picture_sk directory).

Note: Before executing the code, you need to copy all the tables in the Result folder obtained previously to the 'main/RQ1/DrawPicData' directory, or you can directly change the path to read the data.
